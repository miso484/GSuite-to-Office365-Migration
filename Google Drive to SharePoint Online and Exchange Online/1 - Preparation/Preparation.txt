The data export tool currently doesn't support:
    * Chrome Sync (a Core Service for G Suite for Education customers only)
    * Google Tasks
    * Certain types of Drive data:
        * Older versions of images, videos, PDFs, and other non-Google file types that users have marked Keep forever
        * Comments added to images, videos, PDFs, and other non-Google file types
        * Shared drive data for organizations with Drive Enterprise and for organizations that have a mix of different G Suite editions
        * Files in users' trash
    * Data for users that:
        * are suspended, archived, deleted, or have had their license removed
        * are assigned a Vault former employee license
        * no longer have access to some Core Service. Some services delete their data for those users when a G Suite admin turns them off
    * Messages in admin quarantine
    * Pending messages in moderated groups

Data that should be exported using other methods:
    * Data that was deleted by users but is being retained by Vault—A Vault admin can export this data.
    * Cloud Search data—Learn how to retrieve your organization's Cloud Search data.
